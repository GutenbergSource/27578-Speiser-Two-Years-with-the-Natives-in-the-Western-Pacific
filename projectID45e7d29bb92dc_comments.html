<HTML><BODY>This book describes the travels of the Swiss traveler and anthropologist Felix Speiser to the New Hebrides, currently known as Vanuatu, at that time a colony under joint French-English control. His works on the islands still serve as an important reference for the people of these remote pacific islands.

<p>A Dutch summary is already available in PG as etext <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/18023">18023</a>. I am happy now to present the English translation. Maybe the German original will follow.
